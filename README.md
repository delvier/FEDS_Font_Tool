# FEDS_Font_Tool

The Fire Emblem DS Font Tool

## What does FEDS_Font_Tool Do

Currently, de/reciphering 4bpp fonts and deciphering 2bpp fonts (sans FE11's ``fonts/sys``) are implemented. The deciphered output can be opened with [Crystal Tiles 2](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/).

For 4bpp fonts, the tile form is 4bpp GBA, 4-byte skipped, 16×16. Use ``4bpp.pal`` as a predefined palette to see the glyphs clearly.

For 2bpp fonts, the tile form is 2bpp VB, 4-byte skipped; 8×16 for ``fonts/sys_wars`` from FE11 and ``fonts/system`` from FE12, 12×16 for ``fonts/sys_agb``.

## File Specs

### Alpha and Talk
The Fire Emblem DS font files, ``fonts/alpha`` and ``fonts/talk``, are weird. Though the data is quite complicated to understand, there was not a documentation for that, so I had to decipher for a few days and write a documentation for them.

#### Header
From ``0x0+20`` to ``0x300+20``, there are pointers of lower bytes pointing the characters. From ``0x300+20``, each character consists of eight bytes, where the first two are the code point of a character, the next two are the width of a rendered glyph (though, the value cannot exceed 16), and the next four are the pointer to the (ciphered) glyph, all of which are stored in little endian. At the end of each same-lower-byte-group block, four bytes of null are placed as a separator. In the end after the glyph data (thus, footer?), there are pointers to every pointers.

#### Glyph
In short, each glyph is compressed (or, I would say, ciphered) using some sort of [Run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding). The deciphered glyph is of 4bpp format.

The binary data for a glyph is separated into blocks of five bytes.

The first byte indicates if the pixel to be written is transparent or not. A bit ``1`` is for transparent, and ``0`` for coloured.

The following four bytes indicate the amount of transparent pixels or the colour of a pixel. For example, a half-byte ``0xF`` means sixteen (i.e. 0xF + 1) transparent pixels or a pixel coloured F (white), depending on a particular bit of the first byte.

Note that the bits from the first byte should be read from the least-significant bit(bit 0), while the half-bytes should be with human-reading order: Let's see the next example.

* Example Raw data: ``55 0C 5D AE FF``
* The first byte in binary is ``01010101``.
0. Bit 0 is 1, and half-byte 0 is 0. Thus, the first one pixel is transparent.
1. Bit 1 is 0, and half-byte 1 is C. Thus, the following is a pixel with a colour C.
2. Bit 2 is 1, and half-byte 2 is 5. Thus, the following are transparent, and the number of them is 6 ( = 0x5 + 1).
3. Bit 3 is 0, and half-byte 3 is D. Thus, the following is a pixel with a colour D.
4. Bit 4 is 1, and half-byte 4 is A. Thus, the following are transparent, and the number of them is 11 ( = 0xA + 1).
5. Bit 5 is 0, and half-byte 5 is E. Thus, the following is a pixel with a colour E.
6. Bit 6 is 1, and half-byte 6 is F. Thus, the following are transparent, and the number of them is 16 ( = 0xF + 1).
7. Bit 7 is 0, and half-byte 7 is F. Thus, the following is a pixel with a colour F.

When the binary is deciphered, the pixel is drawn by following order on 16-by-16 cells:
* Pixels are drawn from the top row.
* For each row, they are drawn in order of: ``7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 F E D C B A 9 8``. In other words, split by half, left first; for each part, right first.

The binary is read until 256 pixels are filled, so the size of each glyph may not be divisible by five bytes. For example, ``01 F0`` as the last block of the glyph data is valid, if, say, the first pixel coloured F is the last of 256 pixels.

##### Colour
The colours are tones of reds. The below are approximations, except for zero.
Half-byte | Colour

0x0 | (Transparent)
0x1 | #480808
0x2 | #501818
0x3 | #602828
0x4 | #683838
0x5 | #784848
0x6 | #805858
0x7 | #906868
0x8 | #987878
0x9 | #A08888
0xA | #B09898
0xB | #B8A8A8
0xC | #C8B8B8
0xD | #D0C8C8
0xE | #E0D8D8
0xF | #E8E8E8
